This is a template to help you write presentation slides in HTML,
so they can be displayed on the web as well as a live projector.
It uses Javascript to advance to the next slide.

The repo is a presentation in itself: the first slide is index.html .

You can use any browser to present the slides (F11 in Firefox gives
full-screen mode), but I wrote a minimal presentation script that
uses python-webkit:

If you need to make a PDF version of the slides, perhaps because
a conference wants a downloadable version and can't understand a
tarball or zip file, use qhtmlprint:

Of course, PDF will not preserve effects like bullets that appear
one at a time.
