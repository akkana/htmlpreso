This is a template to help you write presentation slides in HTML,
so they can be displayed on the web as well as a live projector.
It uses Javascript to advance to the next slide.

The repository is a self-documenting presentation: after you check
it out, load index.html in a browser (with javascript enabled)
and run through the slides.

You can use any browser to present the slides (F11 in Firefox gives
full-screen mode), but I use a minimal presentation script I wrote
that uses python and webkit, in two versions:

https://github.com/akkana/scripts/blob/master/qpreso
https://github.com/akkana/scripts/blob/master/gpreso

gpreso is for older Linux machines, where python-webkit-gtk works.
But that library has been orphaned, and on newer Linux distros you need
qpreso, which uses QtWebEngine.
I don't know which one works better on Mac or Windows (let me know).

If you need to make a PDF version of your slides, for printing or
because a conference wants a downloadable version and doesn't grok a
tarball or zip file, you can try qhtmlprint:
https://github.com/akkana/scripts/blob/master/qhtmlprint
though it's somewhat brittle -- PDF export/print from Python web
libraries isn't very well supported and doesn't always work.
Of course, PDF will not preserve effects like one-at-a-time bullets
or auto-advance.
