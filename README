This is a template to help you write presentation slides in HTML,
so they can be displayed on the web as well as a live projector.
It uses Javascript to advance to the next slide.

The repository is a self-documenting presentation: after you check
it out, load index.html in a browser (with javascript enabled)
and run through the slides.

You can use any browser to present the slides (F11 in Firefox gives
full-screen mode), but I use a minimal presentation script I wrote
that uses python and webkit:

If you need to make a PDF version of the slides, perhaps because
a conference wants a downloadable version and can't understand a
tarball or zip file, you can try qhtmlprint:
https://github.com/akkana/scripts/blob/master/qhtmlprint
though it's somewhat brittle (PDF export/print from Python web
libraries isn't very well supported and doesn't always work.
Of course, PDF will not preserve effects like bullets that appear
one at a time.
