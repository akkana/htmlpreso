<p>
If you have a widescreen laptop that projects only the left part
of the screen, you can use the right edge of the screen for notes:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;div id="notes"&gt;
Put any notes here you want to see
while you're speaking.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
</div>

</div>

<div id="notes">
The audience won't see the notes,
so you can remind yourself of stories or points
you don't want to forget to mention.
<p>
You'll also see a reminder of the next slide at the bottom right.
</div>

</body>
